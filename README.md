# Portfolio Project

This repository hosts the build files for a personal portfolio website developed using React. The website is deployed on GitHub Pages, showcasing projects, skills, and experiences.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: The portfolio adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, including mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- **React Icons**: Used for visually appealing and intuitive icons.
- **Optimized Performance**: The build files are optimized for fast loading and smooth navigation.
- **GitHub Pages Deployment**: Easily accessible live version of the portfolio.

## Live Website
The portfolio is live and can be accessed at:
[GitHub Pages Link](https://agneepradeep.github.io/portfolio)

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React, React Icons
- **Styling**: CSS (with custom fonts and responsive design)
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages

## Structure of Build Folder
The `build` folder contains the following:
- `index.html`: Entry point for the application.
- `static/js`: Minified JavaScript files (bundled React components and logic).
- `static/css`: Minified CSS files for styling.
- `static/media`: Images and other assets.

## How to Run Locally
Since this repository contains only the build files, the original source files (`src`) are not included. However, you can still serve the build files locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/agneepradeep/portfolio.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the `build` directory:
   ```bash
   cd portfolio
   ```

3. Serve the build folder using a static server. For example, using `serve`:
   ```bash
   npx serve -s .
   ```

4. Open the provided local URL in your browser to view the portfolio.

## Limitations
- The original source code (React components and other files in the `src` folder) is not included in this repository.
- Regenerating the source files from the `build` folder is not possible due to minification and bundling.

## Future Improvements
- Add the full project source code (`src` folder) for easier updates and collaboration.
- Enhance documentation with detailed setup and customization instructions.
